<h1>Explanation of Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that measures how the execution time of an algorithm or a program grows with respect to the size of the input data.It makes us write the efficient code</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another important concept in computer science that measures how much memory space an algorithm or a program uses as a function of the input size. It's similar to above but focuses on the amount of memory required rather than the time taken for execution.It is represnted as <b>O(n)</b> annotation</p>
